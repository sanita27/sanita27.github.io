        The World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) is an annual ranking of countries compiled and published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) since 2002 based upon the organization's own assessment of the countries' press freedom records in the previous year. It intends to reflect the degree of freedom that journalists, news organizations, and netizens have in each country, and the efforts made by authorities to respect this freedom. Reporters Without Borders is careful to note that the WPFI only deals with press freedom and does not measure the quality of journalism in the countries it assesses, nor does it look at human rights violations in general.    </h3>

            <h2>World Press Freedom index scores</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The WPFI is partly based on a questionnaire that previously used seven general criteria: pluralism (measures the degree of representation of opinions in the media space), media independence, environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, infrastructure, and abuses. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The methodology for the WPFI was dramatically changed in 2022 from the methodology used from 2013 to 2021, and the thresholds for each categorisation have been shifted accordingly. The scores are now evaluated against five distinct categories: political context, legal framework, economic context, sociocultural context and safety.
            </p>
            <p> Scandinavia and other Nordic countries usually top the press freedom index because they have strong press freedom protection, low media influence and relatively safe journalists. 
                Many countries in Asia and Africa, on the other hand, often rank lower, where restrictions and threats make it difficult for journalists to work and limit media freedom.</p>
            <p>
                Countries with the highest scores tend to be Norway, Sweden and Denmark, while countries with the lowest scores (i.e. the worst situation) are often countries with dictatorial regimes, such as North Korea and Eritrea.             </p>

                    The highest press freedom according to the 2023 Press Freedom Index is in Norway, which tops the list for the seventh year running. Norway is followed by Denmark and Sweden in second and third place. These countries provide a stable political environment, strong legal protection and economic support for journalists, which contributes to a high level of press freedom.
In contrast, North Korea, Eritrea, China and Vietnam are at the bottom of the list.

                <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                    The following figure shows the Press Freedom Index scores for 2023, ranking countries in five levels of press freedom, from "very serious" (0-40) to "good" (85-100). A black vertical line indicates a median score of 59.2, with special notes for North Korea (21.7) and Norway (95.2). The scores for each country also include additional contextual information available at float, such as scores for political, economic, legal framework, security and socio-cultural context.                </p>

                <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                    The following heatmap compares the press freedom index in different contexts (political, economic, legal, socio-cultural and security) for Norway, Romania and Hungary. Norway, ranked 1st, generally scored the highest in all contexts, while Hungary, ranked 85th, scored lower, especially in the economic context. Romania, ranked 56th, falls in between in most contexts, indicating different levels of challenges to press freedom.                </p>

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                
                The scatterplot illustrates the relationship between press freedom scores and political context scores for different countries, with data points coloured by continent. The graph shows a positive correlation, indicating that greater press freedom is generally associated with a better political context. Countries from each continent are shown in different colours to illustrate the distribution of the data geographically.

                The following scatterplot illustrates the relationship between press freedom scores and legal framework scores, and shows a positive correlation where better press freedom is associated with stronger legal frameworks. Each data point represents a country, coloured by continent, and the size of the circles indicates the economic context score. This visualisation helps to understand how the legal framework and economic context varies across regions and how it affects press freedom.            </p>

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The link between the security situation and the press freedom index is clear: where journalists are safe, press freedom is higher. The lack of security for journalists, whether in the form of physical, legal or psychological harassment, significantly reduces press freedom, as journalists cannot work freely and objectively in such an environment.            </p>

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The Press Freedom Index 2023 shows that while there have been positive developments and progress in press freedom, there are still serious challenges in many countries. Political and economic pressures, new threats in the digital space and the lack of security for journalists are all factors that negatively affect the state of press freedom worldwide. It is important for the international community and local societies alike to continuously monitor and support press freedom so that journalists can work safely and freely.            </p>
